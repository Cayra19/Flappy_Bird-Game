**Purpose:-**

This project is designed by me to understand the following key points:- 

Game Development Basics: Learn how to create a functional game loop and handle user input.
Physics in Games: Implement gravity, velocity, and collision detection.
Graphics and Animation: Work with sprites, backgrounds, and smooth animations.
Scoring and UI: Add scoring mechanics and a user-friendly interface.
Code Organization: Practice structuring a project for readability and scalability.

**# Flappy Bird**

Flappy Bird is a simple yet engaging game recreated as a learning project. It is built to explore and practice fundamental game development concepts, including physics, collision detection, and rendering
graphics with the help of online references and tutorials.

## 📋 Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Smooth animations and increasing difficulty as you progress.  
- **Customizable Bird and Environment:** Modify assets and themes easily.  
- **Responsive Controls:** Simple tap or click controls for any platform.  
- **Scoring System:** Track and display high scores.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (if using a Python version)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm)
- If using VSCode,Python Interpreter must be installed.
  ```bash
  pip install pygame (If any other imports are required, install them with pip)
  If you encounter an error with pip, add the Python installation path (up to the Scripts folder) to the PATH variable under System Variables in Environment Variables.
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cayra19/Flappy_Bird-Game.git
   cd flappy-bird
   ```
2. Run the game:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Objective:** Help the bird navigate through gaps in pipes without crashing.
2. **Controls:**
   - **Space bar:** Start the game and Flap the bird upward.    
3. **Scoring:** Earn points by successfully passing through pipes.

## 🛠️ Customization

Modify game elements by editing the following files:  
- **`gallery/images/`:** Contains images for the bird, background, and pipes.  
- **`main.py`:** Adjust gravity, speed, and other gameplay parameters.

## ✨ Acknowledgments

Inspired by the original Flappy Bird created by Dong Nguyen. This version was built as a fun coding project.

**## Future Enhancements**

Audio:
Add background music to enhance the atmosphere.
Implement sound effects for flapping, scoring, and game-over events.

This will make the game more immersive and enjoyable to play while providing a hands-on opportunity to learn how to integrate audio into a game.

Feel free to tweak this README to better suit your implementation! 😊
